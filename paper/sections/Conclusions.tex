\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

MemPod is a scalable, modular and efficient dynamic memory management mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates significant gains compared to state-of-the-art proposals. The modular design achieved with the use of Pods allows for a more scalable migration mechanism while at the same time enforcing small limitations on migration opportunities.

MemPod use MEA counters to track page access activity and identify hot
pages.  They are dramatically smaller than prior tracking mechanisms
while capturing both activity counts and temporal recency in a way that
provides a more effective prediction of future page access.

%In addition, MemPod leaves a lot to be investigated in future work. We intend to focus on extending our design to support even more complex memory configurations, with the addition of non-volatile memory which adds a reliability aspect. Ordering of migrations could result to incredible increase in performance, as demonstrated in experiment ?? and libquantum, allowing for future research. MemPod could also be used to accommodate memory scheduling mechanisms by utilizing its internal structures, or on the other hand, we could focus on ``Pod-aware'' memory scheduling.
